# Weather Dashboard

A weather dashboard application made from JavaScript, with html and bootstrap css. Utilizing the [opeanweathermap.org Weather API.](https://openweathermap.org/api)

# Description

This project was made for challenge #6 in the UNCC Web Development boot-camp. The goal of this application was to practice utilizing server-side APIs to create a weather dashboard application as well as storing searched cities in the localStorage for easy access within a history section. I was not supplied any starter code and had to create my application from scratch.

- Search the city name.
- You are presented with relevant data pertaining to the city searched.


# Final Thoughts

This challenge was completed at the same time as working on Project 1 for the boot-camp. As such I spent the majority of my time on that. I practiced and continued to learn the relevant skills for this challenge through working on my Project with my group. My group also worked together some on this challenge, which was helpful. I received a fair amount of help in using the API correctly. I feel confident in the outcome and being able to replicate this, however I look forward to returning to this project in the future and reattempting it by myself once I have worked with APIs more in order to test myself without relying on others.
